Train and assess big sym system.
1) Seems like exploitability gets substantially worse over time.  Confirm.
2) Seems like head to head improves and is asymptoting.
3) Would like to know if exploitability decreases when incorporating resolving.
4) Can I look at flop ranges and see if they look wacky?

Progressive resolving.    How can I test if progressive endgame solving is working well?  Evaluate
head to head a system with more bets against a system with fewer bets.  Incorporate progressive
resolving for the system with fewer bets.  What do I expect to see?  Competitive results?
Should be better than translation.  Can do this with unabstracted game.

Redo combined results in debugging that may be stale due to bug fix.

Don't think I have things working currently when the resolving betting abstraction is different
from the base betting abstraction.  Try the smallest possible game.

Try backup approach in which we always solve a subtree rooted at a street-initial node.
Possibly even a turn subgame even when we have reached the river.

Instead of taking a path as input, maybe take a vector of bet sizes per street?
First bet size on the turn, second bet size on the turn, etc.  Always allow one raise
after the last given bet.

We saw some bad results solving street-internal nodes with the unsafe method.  I don't think
this is a bug; I just think resolving at street-internal nodes with the unsafe method is inherently
unreliable.  In the particular case I looked into, the unsafe method yielded poor results because
it failed to take into account that the opponent could change his preflop behavior.  In
particular, he exploited by betting weak hands preflop and again betting the weak hands
postflop and ended up getting too many folds.  The unsafe method assumed that 32o never reached
the node in question because the ranges are locked in, and as a consequence learned to call
more tightly.

Resolving at street-initial nodes will always be better because the chance event (the board
card or cards) introduces randomness into the distributions and ensures that each player has a
mixture of strong and weak hands.

Some options:
1) Use CFR-D or combined subgame solving;
2) Back up and solve the entire street subgame.

Combined method may need some work to account for the fact that the path from the root to
the current resolve node may pass through parts of the tree previously resolved.  The dynamic
CBR calculation may need to look at both base probs and resolve probs.

For CFR-D, why don't we have the opponent best-respond?  What about at the special node -
can he best respond there, or should he mix?

New endgame solving approach: try to force the opponent to prefer the same actions as he did
in the base.  A weaker version of CFR-D.  How would we force this?  Would want this to be a
defeasible constraint.

With lazy initialization we are no longer doing pruning after each opp action in OppChoice().
Does that hurt performance?  We could initialize there.  Does that defeat the point of lazy
initialization?  Maybe not.

Do SetStreetBuckets() lazily.

The hand tree should be linked to the regrets/sumprobs.  root_bd and root_st must be the same.

Is turn resolving too slow?  I saw 12.26 seconds single-threaded for cccc with the big3sym
betting abstraction (one bet and raise postflop).  Down to 3.6 seconds with the new multithreading
code and 8 threads.  I guess that's OK although I think klondikefx reports 2 seconds.  May not
be good enough with multiple concurrent users.

Should lbd and gbd have different types so that we cannot mistakenly pass one to the other?

Do I want to presolve commonly reached turn subgames?  There are 63,000 turn boards, keep in mind.
With 3 second per board, that's 189,000 seconds.  That's over 50 hours.  And that's just one
betting state.  Maybe not.

Allow HandValueTree to be created from multiple threads at once.  There's a way to do this
in C++.  Google "singleton".

Better approx RGBR calculation?

Use ReachProbs in VCFR?  Limit to opponent.

Multithread head_to_head.  

Can we get rid of two nodes in VCFR?

Templating stuff is a mess.
Ugliness in vcfr.cpp, cfr_utils.cpp.
Dynamic casting.
Don't want switch in inner loop (if ints, then this; if doubles, then this).
Need fast implementation of RMProbs(), UpdateRegrets(), ProcessOppProbs().
Maybe VCFR can just have i_regrets and d_regrets, and i_sumprobs and d_sumprobs, and use
  the appropriate one.
We need a switch, but we can do it outside of the inner loop.
May need multiple implementations of OurChoice(), OppChoice().
To keep number of implementations down, require regrets and sumprobs to either both be
  doubles or both be ints.  Need to support chars?
What if regrets and sumprobs are chars?  Cast to ints or doubles as needed.
May need two implementations of OurChoice(), two of OppChoice().

Build a new heads-up system:
1) Will use base for preflop and flop; resolve turn and river
2) Therefore null abstraction preflop and flop
3) Therefore rich betting abstraction preflop and flop w/ one bet and raise turn and river
4) Asymmetric betting abstraction with few bet sizes for us?  Seems like one is too few.
5) Boosting?  Doesn't help by current measures.
6) Reentrant on turn and river?  Doesn't gain much.
7) Quantize on turn and river, at least.
8) Don't save sumprobs for turn or river

Can I run RGBR on holdem/mb1b1 game?  I think it tries to create a HandTree for the entire
game.  Won't fit in memory?  Could instead create hand tree for each max street subgame.
Would that add to the computational cost?

Can I get rid of busy loops and usleep() in new multithreading code.

Investigate board on ms3f1t1r1h5/nxhs3 which leads to such high exploitability.  Any lessons
about card abstraction?

Rename run_tcfr to run_mccfr, change Algorithm setting from tcfr to mccfr.  Rename vcfr
to reflect that CFR+ is the main algorithm.

Evaluate char quantization for flop, turn and river.

Get rid of old and new CFR directories.

Evaluate boosting on game with many betting sequences (mb2b2aai).  Right now seeing no head
to head advantage.  How can I test if there is an exploitability advantage?  Need approx
RGBR program?

Do I want to just use symmetric training so that I don't need to worry about what bet sizes
are most important?

Write show_joint_reach_probs program which shows joint reach probs of every terminal node.
Should be able to reuse code from head_to_head.  Allow sampling of river boards.

Write approx RGBR program.  Support more than two streets.  street_ may not be last street.
Support subgame solving.

Incorporate combined endgame solving into head_to_head; see how well it works.

Experiment with combination of:
1) TCFR
2) holdem
3) kmeans abstraction; null for preflop/flop, 1000 buckets for turn/river
4) Quantize turn and river
5) Asymmetric betting abstraction (asymc)
6) Should I turn off saving of sumprobs for turn/river?  Try that later.

Try CFR+ with a hard warmup.

Can we resolve flops offline like Lars?  Solving flop subgame (mb1b1) taking 7m10s.
6 resolves is 44m, but we will want to use a richer preflop abstraction than mb1b1.
Call it 1 hour.  1755 flops is 1755 thread-hours.  With 8 threads, 220 hours.  About 9
days.  Doable.  On Amazon would be faster.  But if we want a richer preflop or flop betting
abstraction, that's going to make a big difference.

Could make head_to_head twice as fast with unsafe endgame solving.  Solving each subgame twice
now and we don't need to.

head_to_head may repeatedly solve flop or turn subgames.  Should figure out the minimal set
we need to resolve.  Also: if we're going to solve a flop subgame, should we just go ahead
and evaluate every river board consistent with that flop?

Measure speed of turn resolving.  One bet size and one raise size for turn and river.
Add multithreading?  VCFR already supports spinning off threads.  Need to allow control of
what street to split on.

Switch to mb2b2ai as testbed.  More actions may mean:
* TCFR outperforms ECFR
* Boosting helps resolving (not seeing that yet)
* Combined resolving may outperform unsafe resolving

Create resolve params, use for things like head_to_head and solve_all_subgames.  Should help
reduce length of command lines.

Experiment with MCTS as a tool for approximate best-response calculations.

Support progressive endgame resolving.  Including resolves rooted at street initial nodes.

Experiment with multiplayer and reentrancy.  Evaluate with head-to-head?  Can we use h5;
i.e., a 20 card deck?  6 hole cards, 5 board cards, 9 unused cards.  I guess so.

Support multiplayer in endgame solving.  Need to support multiplayer betting trees in
CreateSubtree() in solve_all_subgames.

Build a h5ms3f1p6 system with a non-reentrant tree.  Currently using hs3 buckets, but should
probably do something better for the river, and bucket the turn as well.

Finish converting unsigned ints to ints everywhere.

Get rid of cast to float of cbr values in dynamic_cbr.cpp.

Should I boost CVs instead of boosting regrets?  Can I boost only at leaf nodes?  I don't want
to boost at several nonterminals on the way to a river terminal node, do I?  Wouldn't that lead
to too much boosting?

Boosting at terminal nodes is possibly excessive.  I only want to force players to reach every
nonterminal.  But maybe it wouldn't hurt too much to do so.

For deeply embedded nodes, I am worried about the boosting becoming very attenuated.  Only
1/1000 hands may go down the preflop succ.  Then maybe only 1/1000 down a flop succ.  By the
logic of Targeted CFR, can we do iterations that are forced to go down the boosted succs?

Use newer FileReader and FileWriter classes in slumbot2019

Can we clean up templated code.  Or abandon that approach even?  OppChoice() is a bit of a
mess.  Try to clean that up if nothing else.  Would it help to make VCFR templated?

Incorporate more modern C++:
1) Replace new with unique_ptr everywhere possible
2) Look into std::array and other container we might want to use
3) Use auto wherever possible; e.g., for iterators
4) Use modern C++ multithreading capabilities
5) Use modern C++ mutex capabilities
6) Isn't there a new kind of iteration?
7) Use modern C++ braced initialization
8) Get rid of typedefs.  Used aliases.
9) Use scoped enums.
10) CFRValues should not take pointer to betting tree
11) Replace NULL with nullptr everywhere possible

Fix determ play

It's a mess that we need to pass around root_bd_st/root_bd and if we get it wrong there are subtle
errors.

Is there a discrepancy with suited vs. unsuited hands in TCFR?  Can get very different strategies.

Multithread play and/or play_resolved

Can we get rid of two ways of hole card pair indexing?

Understand why we lost so badly to ackr.  Preflop purification?
