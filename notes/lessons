Seems like aggressive reentrancy doesn't hurt much, at least as measured by head-to-head.

Boosting seems to lead to more reasonable strategies at nodes that are rarely visited by
normal CFR.

Unsafe resolved system outperforms combined head-to-head.  Both when measuring against
each other, and when measuring each against the base.  But the combined system has lower
exploitability.  It might be that the unsafe system has "overfit" to the base abstraction.
Still holds when comparing head-to-head to a system solved to a low exploitability with no
abstraction.

Boosting doesn't seem to improve resolved results (heads-up).

Char quantizing river, short quantizing turn, short quantizing flop seems to work.

Not much difference in exploitability after 200 iterations for ms3f1t1r1h5, ms3f1t1r1h6,
ms3f1t1r1h7, ms3f1t1r1h8, ms3f1t1r9.  Suggests you can do experiments with small decks and get
exploitability numbers that are pretty good approximations of what you'd see for the full game of
interest.

New model of multithreading is superior to old model.  But for solve_all_subgames it's still
better to do the multithreading in solve_all_subgames and not inside VCFR.  Need to preserve
both methods, I guess.  Or, if we don't care about evaluating the new method, we could just
keep the multithreading in solve_all_subgames.
